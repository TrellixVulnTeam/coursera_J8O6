In this project, I built a FFNN to do sentiment analysis of IMDB movie
reviews. It has one hidden layer. I think this network has ~85%
accuracy, which feels pretty good for just working with a bag of
words.

I wrote all the code to do the forward and backprop myself.

I could have made this more general so that I could have added an
arbitrary number of layers.
